Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based facial emotion detection system, which recognizes and classifies emotions from facial expressions in real-time. The model is trained to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, based on labeled facial expression datasets.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Captures and processes video feed to classify emotions in real time.
Deep Learning Model: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion recognition.
Emotion Classification: Classifies emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks & Libraries:
TensorFlow
Keras
Dataset: Labeled dataset of facial emotions (e.g., FER2013)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-emotion-detection.git
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Application:
bash
Copy code
python emotion_detection.py
Video Input: The script will process input from a video feed (e.g., a saved video file) and classify emotions in real time.
Model Training
Preprocess the dataset by resizing images and splitting them into training and validation sets.
Train the CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Results
The model is trained on a labeled dataset and achieves high accuracy in recognizing emotions from facial expressions.
Performance metrics and model accuracy will be displayed during training.
Future Improvements
Testing the model on a live webcam feed for more interactive real-time usage.
Optimizing the model for deployment on mobile devices.
